Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes


Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).

Ingredients

1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

3 ½ teaspoons baking powder

1 tablespoon white sugar

¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste

1 ¼ cups milk

3 tablespoons butter, melted

1 large egg

Directions
Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
