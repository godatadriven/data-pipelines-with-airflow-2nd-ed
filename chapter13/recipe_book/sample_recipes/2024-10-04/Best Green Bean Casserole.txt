Best Green Bean Casserole


A green bean casserole makes the Thanksgiving holiday complete, and this version can be on the table in no time at all thanks to just four ingredients from your pantry or fridge: canned green beans, condensed mushroom soup, French-fried onions, and shredded Cheddar chees


Ingredients

2 (14.5 ounce) cans green beans, drained

1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

1 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions

Directions


Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix green beans and condensed soup together in a large microwave-safe bowl until well combined. Microwave on high until warm, 3 to 5 minutes.

Stir 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese into the green bean mixture. Microwave on high for 2 to 3 minutes.

Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and spread evenly over the bottom. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar over top, then sprinkle with the French-fried onions.

Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and the onions are just turning brown, about 10 minutes.

Recipe Tip
To reheat: Remove the casserole from the fridge and let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. Top with French-fried onions and reheat in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F until the onions are golden brown and the casserole is heated through.
